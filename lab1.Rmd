# Objectives
This lab serves as the starting point for the hands-on portion of IS6481. In this lab, we will set up each of the technologies used in the class. All of the technologies used will be cloud-based, however, some downloads will be helpful in working with some of these. It will be noted below when a download will be helpful.

I have attempted to do exercises in the same order presented in the text. Unfortunately, this is not possible for all of the labs. The text starts at the strategic level and works backward to technology. This is the corret thing to do in real life, but is not optimized for doing labs in the class. You'll see what I mean when you get there. This lab will outline each of the systems we're going to use and will provide resources for further reading. Information from labs will be included in quizzes, so please pay close attention to the material in this (and other) labs.

### Git/GitHub
Git is a version control system. If you haven't heard of this it probably means you haven't done any software development in the last two or three years (which is totally fine, BTW). Version control systems track changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows for experimentation with those files as changes can be rolled back to any prior version. It is incredibly useful when developing software and, as we're finding, doing analytics work.

Git will not be used a ton in this course. I'm mentioning it here because it is terribly important and because all of the materials for the course are stored on Git. In particular, all of the labs are stored on GitHub and can be downloaded there. Some of you may want to work locally for a few of the labs and that can be done easily by checking out the code from GitHub.

Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) as an introduction to Git and GitHub.

It can be easier to interact with GitHub by downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) This is optional.

### Domo
Domo is a cloud-based data warehouse and data visualization platform (disclosure: I work for Domo in my real life). We will be using Domo for a handful of exercises as we can model how data moves from a database or data warehouse, through ETL processes and ends up in a front-end system. Domo also highlights some of the advancements discussed in the text especially around the ability to search for data, the ability to create alerts. and the ability to have reports sent at specified intervals (this will make sense as we go through the course).

You can sign up for a student version of Domo [here](http://www.domo.com/start/student). You will have access to a current version of Domo for one year. Please be responsible regarding what data you bring in to Domo.

### R/Rstudio Cloud
We will use RStudio this semester for two predictive projects/labs. R Studio Cloud is a great product that allows me visibility into your work. I'll have the two assignments there and will be able to see your work w/o the need to transfer files back and forth.

Sign up for your account and access to our workspace [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/20344/join?access_code=2HCnR%2B%2BP8WRCAJOTqOqRrGGEYh4FUi0oWGhIt%2FNb). There will be a longer introduction to R Studio when we get there later this semester.

### AWS
Amazon Web Services is probably the best/most popular cloud service provider. AWS provides everything from simple servers to more complicated machine learning capabilities. It is possible to run all of your IT operations on the AWS platform and many of your favorite products run on AWS (Netflix and Uber come to mind).

To sign up, go to this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), click the "Join AWS Educate" button and sign up as a student.

We will be using MySQL databases hosted on AWS this semster. Later in the semester it might be helpful to use the MySQL Workbench which can be downloaded here.
