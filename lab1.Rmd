# Objectives
This lab serves as the starting point for the hands-on portion of IS6481. In this lab, we will set up each of the technologies used in the class. All of the technologies used will be cloud-based, however, some downloads will be helpful in working with some of these. It will be noted below when a download will be helpful.

I have attempted to do exercises in the same order presented in the text. Unfortunately, this is not possible for all of the labs. The text starts at the strategic level and works backward to technology. This is the correct thing to do in real life, but is not optimized for doing labs in the class. You'll see what I mean when you get there. This lab will outline each of the systems we're going to use and will provide resources for further reading. Information from labs will be included in quizzes, so please pay close attention to the material in this (and other) labs.

### Git/GitHub
Git is a version control system. Version control systems track changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows for experimentation with those files as changes can be rolled back to any prior version. It is incredibly useful when developing software and, as we're finding, doing analytics work.

Git will not be used a ton in this course, except to be a place I can manage and share the materials. I'm mentioning it here because it is a terribly important technology that is used in analytics (and software development) today. Also note that some of you may want to work locally for a few of the labs and that can be done easily by checking out the code from GitHub (here: [https://github.com/is6481](https://github.com/is6481)).

Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) as an introduction to Git and GitHub.

It can be easier to interact with GitHub by downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) This is optional.

### Domo
Domo is a cloud-based data warehouse and data visualization platform. We will be using Domo for a handful of exercises as we can model how data moves from a database or data warehouse, through ETL processes and ends up in a front-end system. Domo also highlights some of the advancements discussed in the text especially around the ability to search for data, the ability to create alerts, and the ability to have reports sent at specified intervals (this will, hopefully, make sense as we go through the course).

You will receive an invite for this course's Domo environment via your university email address. Complete the sign-up process as part of this lab.

### R/Rstudio Cloud
We will use RStudio this semester for two predictive projects/labs. R Studio Cloud is a great product that allows me visibility into your work. I'll have the two assignments there and will be able to see your work w/o the need to transfer files back and forth.

In order to sign up for this courses workspace, visit [this link](https://posit.cloud/spaces/321670/join?access_code=FgQaffuuTXznzKK9ZAyIlsChle1xiRmlI4GW30xG). This is a two stage process where you sign up for an RStudio Cloud account and then sign up for the workspace (using the link above).

### AWS
Amazon Web Services is the best/most popular cloud service provider. AWS provides everything from simple servers to more complicated machine learning capabilities. It is possible to run all of your IT operations on the AWS platform and many of your favorite products run on AWS (Netflix and Uber come to mind).

You should have recieved an email from AWS with instructions on how to sign up for our AWS classroom. Follow the prompts to sign up for the student version of AWS. AWS Academy will require you sign up to a separate Canvas account that is AWS specific. When asked if you already have a Canvas login, answer "No". We will only use that Canvas account to get into AWS. All other assignments will be handled via your standard Utah Canvas account.

Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcY-uiEHhn0). This video is quite basic, but does a great job introducing cloud computing concepts.

We will be using MySQL databases hosted on AWS this semester. Later in the semester it might be helpful to use a SQL development environment. More details to follow later in the semester when needed.

# Summary Instructions
For Lab 1 do the following.

* Git/GitHub
    * Watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY)
    * Be prepared to answer questions in Quiz 1.
* Domo
    * Complete the signup process as outlined in your email.
    * If that signup process does not work, click the "forgot password" link and enter your official Umail email address to reset your password.
* R Studio Cloud - I'm still working out access to RStudio Cloud as it is now a paid product. If I am able to get access, I'll provide instructions when needed. Otherwise, we will use the desktop product.
* AWS
    * Follow the instructions in the email you recieved to setup your account with AWS Educate.
    * Note that you will be allocated enough credits to complete projects for this course. In fact, there will likely be more credits in your account that we need for the course. If you would like to try other technologies not covered in the course, feel free, just be careful you don't use up all the credits before you've finished the assignments.

# To Turn In

* Click the "submit assignment" button and type "I have completed this assignment" to get full credit. This indicates that you have watched the videos referenced here and that you have signed up for Domo and AWS Educate.
* Refer to lecture notes for what topics will be covered in quiz 1.
